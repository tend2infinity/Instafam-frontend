## Hey there!!! 
This frontend part of my App is done using React . For styling purposes I have used materialize css and few google fonts as well !!I have tried my best to give this UI a very identical flavour to the original instagram website .
## Some salient features
### SignIn and SignUp pages 
There is a basic landing page that is my Login page , you can always navigate to the signup screen pretty much similar to Instagram .
### Home page 
After logging in you will see a home screen and you can view all the posts there .
### Navbar
The navbar at the top contains a home icon and other options like create post , my following posts , my profile , all of these are pretty much self explanatory .
### Delete post
The delete post button is also availabe on the posts posted by you . 
### Search functionality
A modal will open as soon as you click the search icon and you can search the users there and get to there profile .
### Like , Dislike , Comment
Why not try these on the website !!
### Post
Each Post contains a header which includes name of the person who posted that, the picture , the like button (which glows red when clicked) and the comment section .

## Many more features are still left , will update very soon
